    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken pakora is a popular Indian snack where boneless chicken pieces are
      marinated with spices, ginger garlic paste and lime juice and then coated
      with a mixture of chickpea flour, rice flour, cornstach, and egg. These
      pakoras are then deep-fried in the oil until they turn golden brown or
      crispy from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After frying chicken pakora, I also add some curry leaves and green
      chilies to the oil. The spiciness from green chilies, crispy curry leaves,
      along with crunchy chicken pakora is just yum.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to make it even more delicious, sprinkle some chaat masala on the top,
      it just elevates the taste all together and gives the pakoras a nice tangy
      twist.

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ajinomoto®) (Optional)</li>
      <li>4 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
      <li>½ bunch green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce (such as Aloha™ Shoyu)</li>
      <li>10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>5 pounds chicken wings</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine cornstarch, sugar, flour, salt, and monosodium glutamate in a
        large bowl. Add eggs, green onions, soy sauce, and garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat chicken dry and add to the sauce. Cover and refrigerate until
        marinated, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Fry chicken in the hot oil until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees
        F (74 degrees C).
