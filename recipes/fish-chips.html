    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Fish and chips is an English dish of deep-fried battered fish, served with
      pieces of deep-fried potato. The dish needs to be served piping hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people swear that it is impossible to cook real fish and chips at
      home: “Fish and chip shops use special equipment and cook at temperatures
      that it is difficult to match in a kitchen at home.”
    </p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds cod fillets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a medium-size bowl of cold water. In a separate
        medium-size mixing bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, and
        pepper. Stir in the milk and egg; stir until the mixture is smooth. Let
        mixture stand for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the potatoes in the hot oil until they are tender. Drain them on
        paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge the fish in the batter, one piece at a time, and place them in
        the hot oil. Fry until the fish is golden brown. If necessary, increase
        the heat to maintain the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) temperature.
        Drain well on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>Fry the potatoes again for 1 to 2 minutes for added crispness.</li>
