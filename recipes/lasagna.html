    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which food was
      being cooked rather than the pasta itself. Lasagna recipes have been
      around for ages, dating back to as early as the thirteenth century. Today,
      lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties from veggies and cream sauces to
      traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as meat lasagnas.

      Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna has been attributed to
      the city of Naples.

      <li>1 (10 ounce) package chopped spinach, thawed and squeeze dried</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles
        and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        In skillet over medium heat, brown the sausage with the onions, garlic
        and 1/2 the parsley; drain excess fat. Add tomato paste, tomato sauce,
        water, Italian seasoning, oregano, and basil; mix well. Simmer, covered,
        for 5 minutes; stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine remaining parsley and ricotta, spinach, Parmesan,
        eggs, garlic salt, and pepper; mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 2 cups sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Begin
        layering with 4 noodles, 1/2 cheese mix, 1/3 remaining sauce, and 1 cup
        mozzarella. Repeat this layer again; the last layer will be noodles,
        sauce and mozzarella cheese. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil; bake,
        uncovered, an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and
        starting to brown. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
